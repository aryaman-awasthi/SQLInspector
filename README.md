# SQLInspector

SQLInspector is a Django project designed to monitor and inspect SQL queries generated by Django's ORM. Understanding the SQL queries being made can significantly help in optimizing database operations, ensuring that the application is running at its best efficiency. By using SQLInspector, developers can easily see the SQL queries generated, which aids in the development and optimization process.

## Why use SQLInspector?

- **Performance:** To ensure that you're using the most performant and efficient ways of fetching data.
  
- **Multiple Models and Relationships:** As your application grows and integrates more complex models and relationships, ensuring that your queries remain optimized becomes crucial.
  
- **Beyond Django ORM:** If your application outgrows the Django ORM, or you find a need to write raw SQL queries, understanding the auto-generated SQL can serve as a helpful guide.
  
- **Diagnostic Tool:** It helps in diagnosing non-performant SQL queries and provides insights into potential optimizations.

## How it Works?

Every SQL query made by the application is recorded. SQLInspector allows you to access these recorded queries and display them in the terminal.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- pip
- virtualenv (optional, but recommended)

### Steps to Setup and Run:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aryaman-awasthi/SQLInspector.git
    cd SQLInspector
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    Make sure you're in the project directory and then run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run Migrations (If Required):**

    Ensure that the database models are in sync with the database schema:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Run the Server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    This will start the development server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Visit this URL in your browser to start using SQLInspector.

<!-- ## Usage:

1. Ensure your application is using SQLInspector's tools to record queries.

2. Perform some operations in your application to generate SQL queries.

3. Access the terminal or the provided interface to view the generated SQL queries. -->
